# NuclearPhaser: Phasing of dikaryotic fungal genome assemblies with Hi-C data

## Background
Most animals and plants have more than one set of chromosomes and package these haplotypes into a single nucleus, usually most often diploid, within each cell. In contrast, many fungal species carry multiple haploid nuclei per cell. Rust fungi are such species with two nuclei (karyons) that contain a full set of haploid chromosomes each. This dikaryotic state has advantages for haplotype phase separation using Hi-C chromatin contact information as the two haplotypes are physically separated.  

NuclearPhaser is a method for phasing of dikaryotic genomes into the two haplotypes using Hi-C contact graphs. 

## Overview of the method
This is an overview of the phasing pipeline for dikaryons:
